                        <p>With our interest in holistic education of children we engage School Managers, Teachers, Parents and Children on different Social issues. We build capacity of stakeholders in the education sector so they can in turn use these relevant skills to better the lots of school children through policies, technics of handling situations as well as the children. Our society is bedevilled by contrary winds trying to derail the appropriate development and upbringing of our young ones. Some of our campaigns are- capacity building on teaching techniques, handling child sexual abuse, Child Protection, Cybersafety, Bullying. This was one of the earliest activities we engaged in as an NGO, we saw the need to intervene in order for to effect change that will secure our future.</p>

                        <p>The Girls Club was set up set up in 2023 when we discovered the need to pay more attention to Girls within the communities we serve. We noticed that more girls were dropping out of school and they could not make other healthy life choices. We gather them monthly to mentor and encourage them. They are also provided opportunity to engage in apprenticeship as well as receiving training for hands-on skills acquisition. This Club seeks to bridge the gaps that exist in modeling an inspiring and focused future for our Girls. Menstrual and Personal Health Hygiene is also largely focused on at our monthly meetings where menstrual and hygiene packs are distributed.</p>

                        <h3>Medical Outreach</h3>
                        <p>The rising cost of accessing health care has been a challenge for the communities where we work. We started this quarterly intervention in 2017 and it has really been helpful in alleviating healthcare poverty among the vulnerable communities where we work. Medical Personnel and Drugs are taken to Communities where they offer counseling, diagnosis and dispense the drugs. Common ailments of malaria, cold, cough, infections, pains are prevalent among these groups of people. For other cases, they are encouraged to visit the hospital and not involve in self medication. At the beginning of the School Term, we carry out deworming exercise for school pupils and counsel on diet and hygiene.</p>

                        <p>In several communities, we identified a "period poverty"- a situation where girls have to miss school during their menstrual flow, many others use unhygienic materials during their flow which leads to complications of infections. On this day, we provide information on Menstrual and Personal hygiene as well as counseling. We distribute sanitary pads, encourage solidarity and support among girls. We commenced this in 2019 as we saw the need to intervene in this area.</p>

                        <p>The best thing we can do to help the Girl Child and indeed our society at large is to pay attention to the Boys. Raise them right with values and support for the girls. We commenced this program in 2015 but, could not sustain it due to lack of committed Male Volunteers to the Cause as well as limited funding. It was revamped in 2021 with only a few meetings taking place. Also in 2023 with only one meeting. We are still trying to see how we can re-strategize on this.</p>

                        <p>We join the World to commemorate this day with activities solely focused on issues that concern women.
For our communities, we carry out needs assessment on pressing needs of women before engaging.
Some of the issues identified are- Reproductive Health Counselling, Emotional intelligence, Self Development, Self Love and Care, Parenting.
Over the years, we have organized programs to address these concerns and more. We provide medical counseling and support to alleviate the cost of living of the women.
Other Women that have excelled in different areas are brought in as role models and they encourage Women to aspire for more, be challenged by the change they want to champion within their communities.
We have been commemorating this Day since 2017.</p>
